IniFile
=======

This package provides easy access to the familiar MS-Windows style .ini
files as well as the Unreal style extended .ini files, where multiple
values can be associated with a single key.

For an .ini file to be recognized it must be of the following format:

    [section]
    key=value           ; comments

Sections must be separated from each other by an empty line (i.e. a
newline on its own).  In our implementation the key must be no longer
than 1024 characters, and contain no high-ASCII nor control character.
On a line, everything after the semicolon is ignored.

Specifcations of section, key and value are to be supplied to methods
via an array reference containing just a section name, or the section
name plus a key name, or the section name plus a key name with its
associated value.
